## 👋 Hi there, I'm Pustam Rai

I'm a **JavaScript full-stack developer** passionate about building scalable and user-friendly web applications.

🌐 I specialize in **frontend development** using **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, and I also work with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to build full-stack solutions when needed.

---

###  What I Do

🔹 **Frontend Development (Next.js + React)**  
I build fast, responsive, and accessible user interfaces using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I focus on performance, clean code, and great user experience.

🔹 **Backend Development (Node.js + Express)**  
I create robust REST APIs and server-side logic using Node.js and Express, often paired with MongoDB for scalable database solutions.

🔹 **Full-Stack Projects**  
From UI to backend integration, I build complete web applications that solve real-world problems—handling authentication and CRUD operations.

🔹 **Continuous Learning**  
I'm constantly learning new tools and best practices to improve code quality, scalability, and performance. Currently exploring **AI integration** into Next.js projects.
